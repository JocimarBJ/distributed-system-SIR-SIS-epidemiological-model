# Distributed System - SIR/SIR Epidemiological Model
This project was developed during Distributed Systems classes, where we had to develop SIR/SIS models to simulate the spread of epidemics in the population. The project was developed in RMI, Parallel, and Sequential for didactic and learning purposes. <br>During development, we had to compare the execution times between the three, discuss their scalability and efficiency, and identify possible problems or limitations.
